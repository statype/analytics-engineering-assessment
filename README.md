## Overview

This repository contains a skeleton [`dbt`](https://getdbt.com) project to which
we would like you, a Data Analytics Candidate, to make some improvements.  The
goal of this assessment is not to produce a perfect or polished result but to
show what you can do and figure out in a short time table so that we might
iterate on it together in the next stage.

If you are unfamiliar with `dbt` you should still be able to complete the
assignment, albeit with a bit more research and reading of documentation.
That's great!  Keep notes and we can talk about your research later.  In the
mean time competency in SQL and the examples in the `models/` directory should
allow you to make progress even without `dbt` experience.

## Getting Started

### Get the assignment

1. This repository is a template repository. Please use the *`Use this template`*
to create a new *Private* repository in your personal GitHub account:
<img src="./docs/artifacts/use_this_template.png" width="800px" height="246px" alt="Arrow pointing to the 'Use this template' button.">

2. On the next screen please select these options:
<img src="./docs/artifacts/create_new_private_repository.png" width="800px" height="617px" alt="Image indicating the use of a clear name, selecting Private as the repository visibility, and an arrow to 'Create repository from template'">

3. Add your Statype contact as an external contributor - they should have
  provided their Github Username but if they forgot please just ask:
<img src="./docs/artifacts/add_collaborator_to_private_repo.png" width="800px" height="500px" alt="Check that you have a private repository by looking for the lock button.  Click settings, then Collaborators, then 'Add people'.">

### Setting up your computer

*Prerequisites*:

- Ensure you have [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed locally.
- Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed locally.

When you open this repository in VSCode you should be prompted to re-open the
project in a container.  Once the devcontainer is running, a Postgres container
will be running , python will be installed, and `dbt` and `sqlfluff` (a
configured SQL linter) will be ready to go.

The database should be pre-loaded with data meaning that if you run
`workspace/acme-corp$ dbt run` (`dbt run` from the `/workspace/acme-corp`
directory) you should not get any errors.  If you do please run `dbt debug` from
the same directory - it should say "All checks passed!" - if not please let us
know.

There are two sets of helper commands in the form of "make targets" e.g.
commands of the form `make <target>` available from two different directories:

- `/workspace` has commands to setup, and reset your database if things aren't
  working.
- `/workspace/acme-corp` has commands to run and test `dbt` models as well as
  lint (check) them for style.

In either directory running `make help` will give you a list of available
commands.

If you have any difficulties with the above please reach out to us and we will
do our best to unstick you.

## The Assignment

Please take 2-3h to complete the following tasks. 3 hours is an absolute
maximum.  We would rather an unpolished working solution after 2 hours than an
incredibly polished and "perfect" solution after 10.)

The model defined in `marts/customers/customer_counts_daily.sql` counts the
total number of customer records created over time as a metric (timeseries).
This *may* be a vanity metric a company might track e.g. "We have had N
customers signup since we launched!"  This does *not* calculate the more
meaningful metric of "how many active customers do we have on day Y?" which is
good for tracking engagement and for reasoning about revenue.

We would like you to build two models: Active Customers by Day and Churn by Day
as both a raw number of churned customers and a percentage of active customers
on that day.  On your way to so doing please feel free to refactor or change our
staging or models in marts.

### Additional smaller tasks

During your work you may notice that there is little in the way of testing or
documentation captured in this project.  These are not a replacement for solving
the core assignments of finding Active Customers by Day and Churn by Day but
should you find that you have some remaining time or that addressing the below
help you acheive the main goals we encourage you to do one or more of the
following (or others we have not addressed - simply describe them in detail in
your solution).

- [ ] Add [Documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation) to Sources and/or
      Models or more sophisticated documentation with ["doc blocks"](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation#using-docs-blocks)
- [ ] Add [Generic Tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests#generic-tests) to our models.
- [ ] Add one or more [Singular Tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests#singular-tests)
      to one or more of our models.

### Submitting the Assignment

Please feel comfortable working on the `main` branch in this repository.  You
may absolutely fork to isolate work on ideas or approaches but merge your
completed solutions to main and then leave your solution alone until our
followup iteration session.
